# Chat-with-Website-using-RAG-Pipeline
Overview

The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to 
interact with structured and unstructured data extracted from websites. The system will crawl, 
scrape, and store website content, convert it into embeddings, and store it in a vector database. 
Users can query the system for information and receive accurate, context-rich responses 
generated by a selected LLM.

Features

Data Ingestion

Crawl and scrape content from target websites.
Extract key data fields, metadata, and textual content.
Segment the content into chunks for improved granularity.
Convert content chunks into vector embeddings using a pre-trained embedding model.
Store embeddings in a vector database along with metadata for efficient retrieval.

Query Handling

Accept natural language queries from users.
Convert user queries into vector embeddings.
Perform similarity searches in the vector database to retrieve the most relevant chunks.

Response Generation

Use an LLM to generate detailed responses based on retrieved information and the user's query.
Incorporate retrieved data into responses to ensure factual accuracy and context richness.
